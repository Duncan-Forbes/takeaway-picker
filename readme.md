# Takeaway Picker

Source code for the takeaway picker found at https://duncan-forbes.co.uk/my-work/takeaway-picker-js/. I have consolidated the styles and scripts into the single php
document for the time being. As you can see the takeaway picker makes use of Advanced Custom Fields enabling takeaways to be added directly via the WordPress dashboard.
